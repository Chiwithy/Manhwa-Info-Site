      The virtual reality game “History of the Archana Continent” <br/>
      became part of reality, and “players” who were synchronized  <br/>
      with humans appeared to protect the world. Lee Hoyeol, who was  <br/>
      an ordinary salaryman, took over the body of the character he  <br/>
      created in middle school, “Grandfell Claudi Arpeus Romeo.” Under  <br/>
      normal circumstances, it would have been an absolute failure of a <br/>
      career, but Grandfell, whose occupation is a “demon hunter,” becomes <br/>
      extremely proud in front of demons! The only demon hunter in this world, <br/>
      Grandfell (= Lee Hoyeol) starts to make a move!
